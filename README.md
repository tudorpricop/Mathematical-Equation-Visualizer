# Mathematical Equation Visualizer

This C++ project has a GUI interface that allows the user to enter mathematical equations in a computerized format. The entire project, including the interface, is implemented using only the primitive graphics.h library. The program is capable of drawing the entered equation on the screen in a format that resembles how it would be written on paper. Additionally, the project includes an algorithm that generates the binary tree of the entered equation, which can also be displayed on the screen.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of good data structures and to showcase how mathematical equations can be represented in a smart way. This is one of my initial projects, and as a result, it lacks a proper file structure and does not strictly adhere to the principles of clean code. Additionally, it does not leverage any object-oriented programming techniques or advanced graphics libraries.

## Features

- User can enter mathematical equations in a computerized format
- Binary tree representation of entered equation can be displayed on the screen
- Equation can be drawn on the screen in a format that resembles how it would be written on paper
- Makes use of good data structures
